<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This is a specially crafted automated Vulnerability Scanner, Patch Management and Exploitation tool for CVE-2021-44228. This is a combination of Python, Java and Linux shell program which will make it easier for a Network Administrator, Endpoint Security Developers and Cyber-Security Analysts to perform Penetration Testing and protect themselves from The Log4Shell vulnerability.

So the Security Analyst can perform the Log4J JNDI attack as well as mitigate the security issue using the integrated patch manager.

This vulnerability analysis tool will be regularly updated as soon as I get the security alerts.
